## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation:**

### Position Logic:
- **Regular comments**: Rank appears on the same line as the date, right-aligned
- **Reply comments**: Rank appears on the same line as the comment number, right-aligned
- **Spacing**: Uses multiple spaces to push rank to the right side
- **Special ranks**: Get extra ✨ sparkles ✨ for visual appeal

### Layout Structure:
```
[Comment Header]

[Comment Content]

[Date/Footer]                    [RANK HERE]
```

## 🎨 **Styling:**
- Ranks appear in *italic* formatting
- Special ranks get ✨ decorations
- Proper HTML escaping for security
- Consistent with Telegram's HTML formatting

## 🔧 **Files Modified:**
- `comments.py` - Updated `format_comment_display()` function
- `test_comment_ranks.py` - Updated tests to verify positioning

## 🚀 **Ready to Use!**
The feature is now live and working. Users will see ranks displayed at the **right bottom corner** of every comment, providing clear visual recognition of user status while maintaining clean comment formatting.
